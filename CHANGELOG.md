⚠️ Contains breaking changes.

### Breaking Changes

- `svgfixer.fix(source, destination, options)` **_=>_** `SVGFixer(source, destination, options).fix()`.
  - It was changed from a wrapper function to a method function for `SVGFixer`.
  - It still returns a `Promise`.
  - `fix()` no more takes in `parameters`, those should be passed into `SVGFixer()`.
- `svgfixer.SVGFixer()` class **_=>_** `SVGFixer()`.
  - The `.setOptions(options)` method has been removed, `options` should now be passed in class constructor as the 3rd `parameter`.
  - The `.setSourceAndDest()` method has been removed, `source` and `destination` should now be passed in class constructor as the 1st and 2nd `parameters`.
  - The `.process()` method has been removed, use `.fix()` instead.
  - `SVGFixer()` does not require the [`new`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) operator anymore.
- `fixConcurrency` has been removed, might be reimplemented on later versions.
